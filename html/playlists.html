			<h3>Weekly Playlist #003</h3>
			<p>In my first weekly playlist, I took some of my favorite songs and put them together. Although in the future I hope to only have songs I discovered that week in my weekly playlist, I feel this serves as a good basis for what my current listening habits are. In this playlist include my favorite acts, such as LCD Soundsystem, Father John Misty, Tame Impala, Talking Heads, Kendrick Lamar, Madvillain, Arcade Fire, and more.</p>
