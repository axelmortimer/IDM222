			<h3>Weekly Playlist #003</h3>
			<p>So I'm actually starting what I said this entire effort was for in the beginning, and only including songs that I have only heard for the first time this week into my playlist. This week definitely has way too much shoegazey, beach-pop guitar, but what can I say, it's about to be spring and I'm excited that I won't be freezing everytime I leave my apartment.</p>

			<h3>Weekly Playlist #002</h3>
			<p>In celebration of his album leaking over a month early and me playing it 24/7, this week is my top ten Father John Misty songs (not including his new album), starting with 10 and ending at 1. This is also an attempt to subconsciously justify how much I just spent on concert tickets for him with the money I didn't have.</p>

			<h3>Weekly Playlist #001</h3>
			<p>In my first weekly playlist, I took some of my favorite songs and put them together. Although in the future I hope to only have songs I discovered that week in my weekly playlist, I feel this serves as a good basis for what my current listening habits are. In this playlist include my favorite acts, such as LCD Soundsystem, Father John Misty, Tame Impala, Talking Heads, Kendrick Lamar, Madvillain, Arcade Fire, and more.</p>
