			<p>My name is Axel Mortimer. I was born on November 8, 1996 in Doylestown, PA. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Central Bucks East High School and attended Penn State for a year before transferring to Drexel University as a sophomore, where I am currently studying for a degree in Interactive Digital Media. As an Interactive Digital Media major, I plan to pursue a career in UX Design and Research, but I enjoy working with life-changing technology in any capacity. Whether it is as simple as messaging your family, or as complicated as navigating virutal reality, interacting with technology should never be a frustrating experience; technology should always feel like it is an extension of yourself.</p>
			<p>When I'm not going to school, studying, or working on projects, much of my time is spent listening to music and going to live shows. I make an effort each summer to go as many music festivals as many possible, and they are consistently the highlight of my year. Just like a squirrel collects acorn in the fall before hibernation, I go to these festivals to collect the "good vibes" which I can carry with me through the school year. All joking aside, I would suggest music festivals to anyone with even a modicum of interest in live music. As an extension of this, I am trying to learn some instruments myself, but I still have a long road ahead of me. I also enjoy some occassional hiking and would like to travel the world once I graduate.</p>
